The next step is to calculate taxable income for AMT which is determined by adding back certain “preference” items into your regular taxable income. There is an exemption amount that is deducted from the AMT taxable income of $40,000* and any excess income is taxed at a flat tax rate of 15%* and certain non-refundable tax credits are allowed to reduce the amount of tax owing. So if your taxable AMT income is under $40,000, AMT will not apply and just the regular tax will be payable.

While there is relief on the first $12.92M per taxpayer, any balance over this amount is subject to tax. In Canada when we die, there is a deemed disposition of our property on the date of death. Tax is then determined based on the type of property we own.

Concerns across the banking sector also spread globally, with UBS purchasing Credit Suisse in an emergency arrangement backed by the Swiss government. So what was the aggregate result of this bad news? Well, global equities continued their upward climb, rising 2.5% for the month and an eye-popping 7.2% for the quarter. Once again, bad news (the bank failures) translated into good news (increases in broad market equity values) as most market players concluded that central banks will be much more reluctant to raise interest rates. The bank failures definitely had a negative impact on the financial sector, but generally helped everything else (at least in the short-term).","marks":[],"data":{}}]},{"nodeType":"paragraph","data":{},"content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"Will bad news continue to be good news going forward?
